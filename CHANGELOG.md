# Changelog

File tracks updates to the emastercard installer. Updates come as new emastercard builds or changes
to the actual package itself.

Versions are tagged following this format: <e-Mastercard version>-<BHT-EMR-API or eMastercard2Nart updated count>. For example the version 4.0.8-0 means we are on the version 4.0.8 of e-Mastercard and on the
latest version of eMastercard2Nart and BHT-EMR-API as the time of the e-Mastercard release. When either
BHT-EMR-API or eMastercard2Nart gets updated then the tag will get bumped up to 4.0.8-1.
